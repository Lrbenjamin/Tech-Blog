## Database Setup
Tech-Blog uses PostgreSQL as its database. The Sequelize ORM is used to manage database interactions.

### Creating the Database:
To create the database and tables, you can run the `sequelize.sync()` method during the initial setup. The `sequelize.sync()` method is already included in the `server.js` file and will automatically create the necessary tables when the server starts.

## Deployment
The application is deployed on Render.

### Deployment Steps:
1. Set up a PostgreSQL instance on Render.
2. Ensure all environment variables are set correctly in the Render dashboard.
3. Deploy the application using Render's web service configuration.
